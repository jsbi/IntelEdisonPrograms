So I have heard alot about MQTT and CoAp in the past couple of days, so I thought I would give it a shot and write a simple application using the same.

So to start with, MQTT can be installed by the instructions given here: http://mosquitto.org/download/

This is where you should start, it has everything you need to know to start using it:

Those who plan to use 2lemetry and follow the proces for the same, please make a note of the fact that the publish /subcribe topics given on the tools sections are the ones you have to use too. You will not have permissions to use the other topics yet, there is a process involved to make it work which I am yet to figure out.
